# LollipopTests

Simple two-activities app (optimized for a Xiaomi Mi4 screen, because that was not the point).

Trying to work on various patterns introduced in Android 5.0 Lollipop and Material Design.

List of things in there : 
  - Vector Drawable
  - Animated Vector Drawable
  - Palette
  - CircularRevealAnimation
  - Elevation
  - TranslationZ + scale when an item is touched
  - Shared elements in activity transition
  - Staggered animations
  - FAB
